# Plant Sentience

## Project Description

Plant Sentience is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that creates digital identities for plants and tracks their health metrics in real-time. By combining IoT sensors, smart contracts, and decentralized technology, we give plants a "voice" in the digital world, allowing them to communicate their needs and well-being through immutable blockchain records.

The platform enables plant owners to register their plants, monitor vital signs like soil moisture, light exposure, and temperature, and maintain a permanent, tamper-proof record of their plant's life journey. Multiple caregivers can be authorized to update plant data, making it perfect for shared gardens, research facilities, or plant-sitting arrangements.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to bridge the gap between the natural world and digital technology, creating an ecosystem where plants have verifiable digital identities and their health data contributes to larger environmental and agricultural insights. We envision a future where:

- Every plant has a unique, immutable digital identity
- Plant health data contributes to climate change research
- Urban gardening communities can share and collaborate on plant care
- Agricultural research benefits from decentralized, transparent plant health data
- Environmental conservation efforts are supported by real-time ecosystem monitoring

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.19
- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat or Truffle framework
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/plant-sentience
cd plant-sentience

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Usage Example
```javascript
// Register a new plant
const tx = await plantSentience.registerPlant("My Rose", "Rosa rubiginosa");
const plantId = await tx.wait();

// Update plant metrics
await plantSentience.updatePlantMetrics(plantId, 65, 75, 245); // 65% moisture, 75% light, 24.5°C

// Add a caregiver
await plantSentience.addCaregiver(plantId, "0x742d35Cc7aA5A8e1d2C4...8e6DA2c7367f98");
```
